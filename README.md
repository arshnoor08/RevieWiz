# RevieWiz

RevieWiz is a chatbot designed to scrape Amazon reviews, convert them into actionable insights, and answer user queries about products based on those reviews. 

## Technologies used: 
* Web Scraping: Scrapes product reviews from Amazon using BeautifulSoup.
* PDF Interaction: Converts reviews into a PDF and uses JSON embeddings for chatbot-user interaction.
* OpenAI API: Uses the OpenAI API keys and the GPT-4o mini model for interaction.
* Informed Responses: Answers user questions about products based on the reviews.

## Set Up
Before running revieWiz, you need to set up your environment:

OpenAI API Key: Obtain an API key from OpenAI and set it as an environment variable. The key added in RevieWiz.ipynb has been disabled and should be replaced with a valid key for the model to work.

Title: 5.0 out of 5 starsClassic 
Review: Let me say, The herringbone is a chain that never goes out of style. Its stylish and its elegant shine enhances your outfit! The necklace is strong and sturdy. The clasp is Well made. It does not fade. I wore this chain in the shower, after a night of [cocktail]. Oops  Its not affected by the rain. Nor, does the suns rays, or The bodys perspiration change a thing! I love the width. Its not bulky or heavy on the neck. I would definitely be purchasing from this merchant again. Whaaaat a gurl must have plenty of options #LayersRead more

Title: 4.0 out of 5 starsCute, watch your hair though
Review: Super adorable. And just as it looks in the pictures. My one thing I would say to look out for though is it easily gets wrapped in long hair and is difficult to untangle it from your hairRead more

Title: 5.0 out of 5 starsVery sparkly necklace
Review: I love these necklaces, they are so pretty on and look amazing.  The only issue I have is they sometimes get twisted, but I don't see how you can avoid that besides only wearing one at a time.  And my hair got caught in it when I had hair spray in it.Read more

Title: 3.0 out of 5 starsSnake chain is wiggly
Review: The media could not be loaded.I liked the idea of some thing thin and dainty but in a snake chain, very thin equals very wiggly as you can see in my video. I dont end up wearing them often because of that and I go for something thats a little thicker so it holds its shape better.Its a great price and it is in great condition though.Read more

Title: 5.0 out of 5 starsGorgeous necklace
Review: I purchased this in the white gold. I like that it was adjustable in length and it was so shiny! It looked as though I had tiny diamonds on. Easy to dress up or as I wore it, with jeans and a t-shirt for casual dress. Very nice quality of thickness too! Not so dainty that you feel it will break, but still very feminine.Read more
